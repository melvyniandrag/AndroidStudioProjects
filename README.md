# Android Studio Projects

These are various projects from the internet. Probably all of them are google tutorials that I've worked on.

For example, the first on I'm uploading here is a google cupcake app that was deprecated by google. Just seeing what needs to change to bring it up to date. Refreshing my memory about old stuff in Android and learning about new stuff as I update the app.

An example of a change is that there used to be a `Transformations.map()` that you could use on `LiveData`, but not you just use `.map()` with a lambda.
